Write a function that reverses a string (no native methods string.prototype.reverse):

1. Iteratively --> [use for loop]
2. Recursively --> [functions that call themselves]
3. Iteratively, in one pass, without a temporary string variable



--AJAX, Conditional Rendering and React Router--

In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application.

Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JS operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing
the current state, and let React update the UI to match them.
