    React is good for breaking down a problem into smaller sub-problems
  

    - know the difference between states
    - you should never have things in your state function that are not in your render function

  Will demos how slack uses react:

We defined one component - one message in a channel:
  POST COMPONENTS:
  - Avatar: string
  - Name: string
  - Time: number
  - Status: string
  - Message: string
  - RowID: number
  - Reaction: array
  - NavAction:
  - then break this into a sub component:
    - message header: 
        - define some data that it needs to do its job
            -name, status, time
        - stateless, because it doesn't change
    - message component:
        - takes in a message
        - type [text or snippet]
        - stateless because it doesn't change
    - avatar:
        - path url
    - reaction:
        - takes reaction array 

- we can compose this however we like whenever it comes time to putting it together
- the whole point of decomposition is to build more things just like legos
